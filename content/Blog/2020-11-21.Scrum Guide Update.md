Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland just updated the Scrum Guide for the 5th time. Like in 2017 you can [download the latest version](http://scrumguides.org/download.html) or listen to the [update interview](https://www.scrum.org/resources/2020-scrum-guide-launch-event-recording) or watch the one hour video directly on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Dfxo3PZwDI8). Read on if you just want to grasp the gist.

## What has changed?

### Shorter, clearer

The Scrum Guide is much shorter and clearer. How come?

1. Scrum is still Scrum. Now even **shorter**, on 13 pages instead of 19.
2. Scrum can be used for **all sorts of product development**, not just software. Now all references to software development have been removed.
3. There is still value in the removed parts from the 2017 version, like the _Daily Questions_. But the Guide shall **explain Scrum as clear and precise** as possible, not how to do it, so those references have been removed as well.

But what has changed within?

### Scrum Team

1. There is only **a Scrum Team**. It has a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and Developers. Full stop. There's no longer a _Development Team_.
2. Roles have gone, they are **accountabilities** now. As above, we have Developers, a Product Owner, and a Scrum Master.
3. By the way, **developers are not specifically software developers**, they are the guys who make the increment happen.

### Commitment to artefacts

1. The **Product Goal** is the commitment guiding the **Product Backlog**.
2. The **Sprint Goal** is the commitment guiding the **Sprint Backlog**.
3. The **Definition of Done** is the commitment guiding the increment.

The _Product Goal_ is newly introduced as the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. 

### Self-managing instead of self-organized

Oh, bust, all those well-meant slides are just gone for good ;-). Spot the difference:

2020

> **Scrum Teams** are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also **self-managing**, meaning they internally decide **who does what, when, and how**.

2017

> **Self-organizing teams** choose **how best to accomplish their work**, rather than being directed by others outside the team. ... **Development Teams** are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work.

The focus is on the _Scrum Team_ now, not only on the Development Team. In addition the _what_ gains importance.

## Go further

Actually I like the comparative post on [scrum.org from Simon Flossmann in German](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/was-ist-neu-im-scrum-guide-2020-update-7-dinge-die-du-unbedingt-wissen-solltest). Concise and precise. You might want to have a go and play [Scrum Jeopardy on JeopardyLabs](https://jeopardylabs.com/play/scrum-guide) to test your updated knowledge. Or you might just read the [Scrum Guide 2020](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf).
