### Q:
I have rather long package names, and to see the class under construction I have to scroll a lot or waste a lot of screen space. I could abbreviate the package names with "*Window | Preferences | Java | Appearance | Compress all package name segments, except the final segment*", but I'd rather prefer to see more than just the final segment.<!--more-->

### A:
You can configure package name abbreviations since Helios (3.6) onwards. Go to *Window | Preferences | Java | Appearance* to set up abbreviation rules.

For example, `com.kennethbrodersen.simplepod` could be configured to be displayed as `{simple}` with the rule `com.kennethbrodersen.simplepod={simple}`.

`com.kennethbrodersen.simplepod.util.logging` will then be presented as `{simple}.util.logging`.
