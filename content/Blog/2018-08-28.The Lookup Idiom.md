Why don't I call it the "Lookup Design Pattern" which will probably generate more readers? Because an idiom is an idea to work around the quirks of a language. A design pattern is more a common concept and and is as such agnostic to specific programming languages.

Yeap, some programming languages have certain patterns "build in". Proofs the concept. For me, idioms are more low-level concepts.
