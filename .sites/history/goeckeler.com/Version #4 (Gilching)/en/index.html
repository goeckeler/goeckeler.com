<h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>You just made it to the private homepage of the G&ouml;ckeler family. 
	This site is intended for our friends and relatives - who live in Germany, England, 
	the <acronym title="United States of America">U.S.</acronym>, and many other countries.
	If the idea to visit us may cross their mind, this is the place to look for directions and stuff.</p>
	<p>Well, and as we are a family now, this is of course the place for all the 
	cute baby pictures.</p>
	<p>Of course everyone is invited to browse our site. Feel free. 
	May-be one or the other is inclined to write us an email, and if it just
	to tell us how impressive this homepage is ;-)</p>

<h1>Thursday, October 14<sup>th</sup>, 2004</h1>
	<p>New layout, new provider, more space, more pictures, complete revision of the sites. And all pages also in English. Hope you like the new layout.</p>
<h1>Wednesday, March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2004</h1>
	<p>Missing a digital camera means it takes a bit longer to present an album online. Thus we only started of with the first <a class="in" href="gallery.html">gymnastics session</a> of our offspring.</p>
