<h1><a name="destination">Destination: Am Hang 1a &middot; 82205 Gilching &middot; Bavaria &middot; Germany</a></h1>
<p>Rough guide: about 30 kilometers or 20 miles west-south-west of Munich, F&uuml;rstenfeldbruck is to the north, Starnberg to the south. It is about 12km / 7 miles to the lake W&ouml;rthsee, 14km / 9 miles to the lake Ammersee and 15km / 10 miles to Lake Starnberg.</p>
<h1><a name="far">From far and abroad</a></h1>
<h2><a name="far-air">By plane</a></h2>
<h3><a name="far-air-munich">Munich Airport (Franz-Josef-Strau&szlig;)</a></h3>
<p>Take the tube, which is called S-Bahn. You need line S1 towards Munich East, named Ostbahnhof in german. Transfer at Laim to line S5 towards Herrsching or We&szlig;ling. You need to change the platform though. Exit in Gilching-Argelsried. Takes roughly 1.5 hours. Tickets are &euro;9 (Single return ticket, "Tageskarte Gesamtraum") or &euro;15 (Double return ticket i.e. for two persons, "Partner-Tageskarte Gesamtraum"). One-way-tickets are the roughly the same price, however the return tickets are One-Day-Tickets so you can go for a shopping tour right away. Pricing as of August 16<sup>th</sup>, 2002.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can take line S8 towards Nannhofen or Maisach. Takes a bit longer, say 15 minutes, but you don't need to change platforms, and you can transfer indoors. Get off at any station from Munich East (Ostbahnhof) to Laim, preferably at Rosenheimer Platz or Marienplatz, stay on the platform and get the next S5 towards Herrsching or We&szlig;ling.</p>
<h2><a name="far-train">By train</a></h2>
<h3><a name="far-train-munich">Munich Central Station (Hauptbahnhof)</a></h3>
<p>Take the tube (S-Bahn), line S5 towards Herrsching or We&szlig;ling. Exit in Gilching-Argelsried. Takes about half an hour. You need either a One-Day-Ticket ("Tageskarte Gesamtraum"), a Single Ticket for 2 zones, or a so-called Streifenkarte. With the ladder you need to stamp 4 sections (a section is called a "Streifen" on a ticket, thus the name).</p>
<h3><a name="far-train-pasing">Munich Pasing</a></h3>
<p>If the train also stops at Pasing you can take a shortcut. Transfer at Pasing to the tube at the same station, and take line S5 towards Herrsching or We&szlig;ling as above. Same pricing.</p>
<h2><a name="far-car">By car</a></h2>
<h3><a name="far-nuremburg">Taking the highway from Nuremburg (N&uuml;rnberg)</a></h3>
<p>Change at "Kreuz Neufahrn" from the A9 to the A92 towards Feldmoching or Stuttgart respectively. At the end of the A92 follow the directions towards Dachau / Stuttgart, the highway becomes the A99 then. Follow the highway until the exit "Lochhausen" - you can do so if you take the left or middle road in the first and only big tunnel. So when the A99 splits, do no longer follow directions to A8 Dachau / Stuttgart, but follow directions to A8 Munich (M&uuml;nchen). At the exit Lochhausen get off the highway, get into Munich. Straight through the big roundabout, then to the right at the traffic lights directly after the roundabout. Follow directions to A96 Lindau until you hit the highway again.</p>
<p>Once on the A96 towards Lindau drive on until the exit Gilching-Argelsried. Get into Gilching by following the sign to Argelsried. Follow the main street until the second traffic lights, then drive right into Rathausstra&szlig;e, take the next to the left and park your car. Congratulations, you made it!</p>
<p>If for any reason you missed the split and now you are on the A8 towards Stuttgart see below.</p>
<h3><a name="far-stuttgart">Taking the highway from Stuttgart</a></h3>
<p>Follow the highway A8 towards Munich (M&uuml;nchen) until the exit Dachau / F&uuml;rstenfeldbruck. Follow the signs to F&uuml;rstenfeldbruck (B 471). Get off at <strong>F&uuml;rstenfeldbruck Mitte</strong>, turn right and turn right again at the traffic lights. You can see directions to Munich (M&uuml;nchen). Follow the main road, if in doubt or in case of building sites always look for directions to Munich (M&uuml;nchen).</p>
<p>Afer you left F&uuml;rstenfeldbruck you are on the road B2 going on towards Germering / M&uuml;nchen. After the hill pay attention as you need to turn right to take the road to Alling or Gilching respectively. Go on, pass through Alling, the next town is Gilching. In Gilching drive on until you see a supermarket called "Plus" on your right hand side. Turn left at the next traffic lights. Immediately take the next to the left, and your reached your destination.</p>
<h3><a name="far-garmisch">Taking the highway from Garmisch-Partenkirchen</a></h3>
<p>Follow the highway A95 to Munich. Exit towards Starnberg. In Starnberg turn right once you see the directions towards Gilching or F&uuml;rstenfeldbruck. Follow the road and about 20 kilometers / 13 miles later you hit Gilching. At the second traffic lights turn right into Rathausstra&szlig;e, turn immediately left and there you are.</p>
<h3><a name="far-salzburg">Taking the highway from Salzburg or Innsbruck</a></h3>
<p>Okay, braveheart, follow the highway A8. At "Kreuz M&uuml;nchen S&uuml;d" take the middle right lane towards A99/A96 Lindau. Once in Munich always follow directions to Lindau or A96. You are on the so-called "Mittlerer Ring", so in doubt always follow the road.</p>
<p>Shortly after the "Luise-Kiesselbach-Platz" (don't worry, you don't need to spot it) you will get out of Munich as you will turn on the highway A96 towards Lindau. Exit at Gilching. Turn right towards Argelsried. Once into town follow the main road, turn right after the second traffic lights into the Rathausstra&szlig;e. Immediately turn left and turn the key. You made it.</p>

<h3><a name="near-road">Taking country roads</a></h3>
<p>Follow the "Landsberger Stra&szlig;e", later called "Bodenseestra&szlig;e", straight on through Aubing, Germering and Geisenbrunn. In Geisenbrunn follow directions towards Gilching-Argelsried which is a right-left combination. Follow the road right up to the end, then turn right. You are on the main road and that means turn right at the second traffic lights into Rathausstra&szlig;e, turn left again, stop.</p>
