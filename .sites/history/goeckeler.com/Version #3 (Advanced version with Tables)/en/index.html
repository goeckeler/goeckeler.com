    <p>Hello and welcome to the private homepage of the G&ouml;ckeler family. 
	This site is intended for our friends and relatives - who live in Germany, England, 
	the USA, and many other countries. If the idea to visit us may cross their mind, 
	this is the place to look for directions and stuff.</p>
	<p>Well, and as we are a family now, this is of course the place for all the 
	cute baby pictures.</p>
	<p>Of course everyone is invited to browse our site. Feel free. 
	May-be one or the other is inclined to write us an email, and if it just
	to tell us how impressive this homepage is ;-)</p>

	<p>New provider, more space, more pictures. And all pages also in English. Hope you like the new layout.</p>
    <H2>Wednesday, March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2004</H2>
	<p>Something new from time to time. In this case we uploaded some pictures of Timo. Not too many though, as we have not enough available webspace. You want to see them? Just go to the  <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a>.</p>
